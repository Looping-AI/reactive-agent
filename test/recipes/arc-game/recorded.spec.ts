/**
 * Integration coverage for the arc tools against the **real** ARC-AGI-3 API,
 * recorded once and replayed on CI (VCR pattern via undici SnapshotAgent — see
 * test/helpers/vcr.ts). `setupRecording()` gives each test its own cassette,
 * auto-named from the file + describe + test names (test/helpers/vcr-spec.ts),
 * stored under test/snapshots/.
 *
 * Unlike tools.spec.ts, this spec does NOT stub `fetch`: the tools' real global
 * fetch flows workerd → Miniflare → the VCR agent, which records real responses
 * (`npm run test:record`, needs a real `ARC_API_KEY` in `.env.test` — see
 * .env.test.example; add `-- -t "<name>"` to record one test) and replays them
 * from the committed cassette otherwise. Assertions are on response *shape*, not
 * exact values, so re-recording a different game doesn't churn them.
 *
 * A missing cassette **fails** the test with a "record it" message (never skips),
 * so an unrecorded spec is visible in CI.
 *
 * This drives the whole flow in the order it really happens: the main agent
 * lists games, the recipe leases a card, a subagent plays on it, and the score
 * is read back **while the card is still open**. That last step is the one
 * assumption the whole design rests on — nothing closes a card any more — so it
 * is pinned here against the live API rather than a stub.
