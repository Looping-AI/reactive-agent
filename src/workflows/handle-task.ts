/**
 * The async task controller. The gateway no longer waits for a synchronous reply:
 * the Worker accepts a turn (returns a `submitted` Task) and hands the actual work
 * to this durable Workflow, which orchestrates it end to end and delivers the
 * reply to the gateway's push-notification webhook.
 *
 * The shape is a **round loop**, not a fixed sequence of phases:
 *
 * 0. **Pre-work** — resolve the caller's agent, mark the Task working.
 * 1. **Round** — one main-agent inference that either answers the user (the Task
 *    is done) or delegates 1..8 durable Subtasks plus the acknowledgment the user
 *    sees while they run.
 * 2. **Execute** — a delegating round's Subtask DAG runs in waves, every
 *    dependency-ready node concurrently, each in an isolated managed subagent.
 *    Then the loop returns to 1, where the model sees the results and decides
 *    again — answer, or delegate once more.
 * 3. **Deliver** — persist the terminal Task, then POST a signed callback.
 *
 * The main agent is never forced either way. A round that has run out of budget —
 * `MAIN_AGENT_LIMITS`, in turns or in wall clock — is handed no tools but the
 * answer, so it has to give one; every other round chooses. That is the whole
 * reason this file is a loop, and the whole termination argument.
 *
 * Why a Workflow (not a DO alarm / `waitUntil`): `step.do(...)` gives durable,
 * independently-retried steps that survive isolate eviction, and a future
 * `escalate` decision (ask the human, then continue) slots in cleanly as another
 * branch of the loop built on `step.waitForEvent(...)`.
 *
 * A Workflow is a separate entrypoint and cannot touch the agent DO's SQLite
 * directly, so: the task inputs travel as the workflow **payload**, and the agent
 * runtime + task state are reached only through **native DO RPC** — see
 * {@link file://../reactive-agent/index.ts}.
 *
 * Idempotency: the instance id is derived from the gateway's `messageId`
 * (deterministic across dispatch retries), so a re-dispatch never starts a second
 * run. Within a run, every step is re-runnable: the Subtask rows and the Session
 * are the source of truth, and each round recovers from them rather than
 * re-inferring.
