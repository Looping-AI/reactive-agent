  return `## Playing an ARC-AGI-3 game

When the user asks for a game to be played (e.g. "play game ls20"), you can
delegate in parallel subtasks of "type": "arc-game" per game they named.

Each of those subtasks carries "params": { "game_id": "<id>" }, an exact id from
\`arc_list_games\`. The param is what starts the play, and the "prompt" is never a
substitute for it. Restate the request in the "prompt" as well (e.g. "Play the
ARC-AGI-3 game ls20."), so the subagent knows what it was asked for.

If the request does not name a game, or names it loosely — call \`arc_list_games\`
first and delegate the id associated with "ls20". Never invent an id or pass through
the user's wording as one. If nothing in the list matches well enough to choose, 
ask the user which game they mean with \`${names.finalReplyTool}\` rather than guessing.

These subtasks take several minutes — acknowledge in your "reply" that you have started playing 
and will report back, without promising a time.`;
