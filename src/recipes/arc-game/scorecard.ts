/**
 * The `arc-game` recipe's scorecard policy: which card a play runs on, and what
 * that play scored.
 *
 * Neither is a model's decision any more. The ARC API auto-closes a card after
 * ~15 minutes idle, which makes the whole open/close lifecycle the *server's* —
 * so the only judgement left is arithmetic: a card used recently is still alive
 * and every concurrent play should share it; an older one is gone and a new card
 * has to be opened. That is {@link resolveScorecard}, run by the parent once per
 * durable chunk (a subagent facet has no DB, so it cannot own this).
 *
 * Because nothing closes a card, the score is *read* rather than returned:
 * `GET /api/scorecard/{card_id}` works on an open card, and
 * {@link gameScoreReport} appends the finished game's entry to its play's report.
 *
 * Handlers are exported separately from any tool wiring so they unit-test without
 * an LLM, and {@link ScorecardStore} is a narrow interface (`AgentDB.scorecards`
 * satisfies it structurally) so tests can pass an in-memory fake.

 * between two bumps — not a whole play.
