/**
 * One **round** of the main agent: a single inference over the agent's continuous
 * Session that ends in one of two decisions — answer the user, or delegate.
 *
 * This is the whole task pipeline's control point. The Workflow runs rounds in a
 * loop: a round that delegates gets its Subtask DAG executed and is followed by
 * another round; a round that answers ends the Task. So "compose" is not a
 * separate phase with its own rules — it is simply the round in which the model
 * decides it has enough to answer.
 *
 * Two layers of tools, and the difference is the design:
 *
 * - **Work tools** (`recall`, `browser_*`, the Session's `set_context`) carry an
 *   `execute` and run *inside* the round's tool loop. They never end a round; the
 *   model keeps reasoning over their results. Every round gets them except the one
 *   the budget forced — looking something up before answering is ordinary work,
 *   not a special phase, right up until there is nothing left to spend on it
 *   (see {@link RoundMode}).
 * - **Control tools** — `delegate` and `final_reply` — have no `execute`. The call
 *   *is* the round's output: the loop halts on it, and for `delegate` the Workflow
 *   performs it durably. Because the loop halts, the SDK never validates their
 *   input either, so each one checks its own and the round repairs what it rejects
 *   — see {@link file://./control.ts control.ts}. A future `escalate` (ask the
 *   human) is the same shape: another entry there, another variant of
 *   {@link TurnDecision}, another `case` in the Workflow's switch.
 *
 * Nothing forces the *choice*, and that is deliberate. An earlier design pinned
 * `toolChoice` to a specific tool to force delegation in one phase and forbid it in
 * another, which meant a request the main agent was best placed to answer got
 * shipped to a memoryless subagent, and material that came back could only ever be
 * turned into prose. That is still rejected: the model picks its own ending, and
 * delegating twice is allowed.
 *
 * What *is* forced is that the round end in a control call at all —
 * `toolChoice: "required"`, with both endings declared as tools. Plain text used to
 * be an outcome, and it made narration indistinguishable from an answer: a model
 * that wrote "I'll start the game" and emitted no call ended the Task successfully
 * having done nothing. Two named tools is also a much easier discrimination for a
 * small model than prose-versus-tool, which is what the weaker fallback models
 * consistently got wrong. See {@link file://./final-reply.ts final-reply.ts}.
 *
 * The model reasons over the whole conversation but references it by **catalog
 * index only** — see {@link renderTurnMessages}.

# Answering this request

You are replying to the user yourself. You have two ways to end this round, and the
choice is yours:

**1. Answer directly.** Call the \`${FINAL_REPLY_TOOL_NAME}\` tool with your reply. Do
this whenever the request is yours to answer — anything about this conversation,
your own history, memory, or tools, and anything you can settle with the tools
available to you here. Use those tools first if they help: look something up,
recall older history, then answer.

**2. Delegate.** Call the \`${DELEGATE_TOOL_NAME}\` tool to hand work to isolated
subagents that run concurrently — research, long-running jobs, or anything better
done in parallel by a capable stranger. Their results come back to you, and you
then decide again: answer, or delegate once more.

Do not delegate work you can simply do. Do not answer from thin air work that
genuinely needs doing.

**Every round must end in one of those two calls.** Prose on its own does not reach
the user and does not start any work — if you decide to do something, make the call
that does it in the same turn rather than describing what you are about to do.

## Delegating

\`${DELEGATE_TOOL_NAME}\` takes:

- "reply": the acknowledgment the user sees while the work runs, in your own voice.
  Say what you are doing about their request. Do not promise a delivery time, and
  do not mention subtasks, subagents, or this process.
- "subtasks": between 1 and ${MAX_SUBTASKS} units of work. Use exactly as many as the
  request genuinely needs — one is the right answer for a simple request. Prefer
  fewer, larger subtasks over many trivial ones.

Each subtask has:

- "localKey": a short unique identifier within this call (e.g. "research"). Must not
  be blank.
- "type": exactly one of ${SUBTASK_TYPE_KEYS.map((k) => `"${k}"`).join(", ")}. These are
  the only accepted values — any other word is rejected and the whole call fails.
  Pick "general" for ordinary work; see the tool description for what each type
  does and which params it needs.
- "prompt": a complete, self-contained instruction, and never blank. The subagent
  executing it has no memory, no conversation history, and no access to this
  session — everything it needs must be in this prompt or in the references you
  select. Write it as an instruction to a capable stranger.
- "referenceIndexes": the indexes of conversation turns the subagent must read
  verbatim, chosen from the turns marked "[ref N]" below. Reference only what that
  subtask actually needs. Turns without a "[ref N]" marker cannot be referenced;
  if information from one matters, restate it in the prompt yourself.
- "dependsOn": the localKeys this subtask needs the output of. Leave it empty for
  work that can start immediately. Dependent subtasks receive their prerequisites'
  output. The graph must be acyclic, and may only reference subtasks in this same
  call.

Subtasks with no dependency between them run at the same time, so only add an edge
where output genuinely feeds input.

Ask each subtask for the **material** you need, not for a finished answer: its
output is raw material for you, never something the user sees directly.

## Using results that have come back

When a \`${DELEGATE_TOOL_NAME}\` call's results are already in this conversation, they are
yours to use. Put your answer in a \`${FINAL_REPLY_TOOL_NAME}\` call, in your own voice —
do not paste results verbatim, introduce them as "subtask output", or mention
subtasks, subagents, or delegation. The user asked you.

If some work failed or was skipped, say plainly what you could not do, in one
short sentence, without diagnostics or blame — then give them everything you did
manage. Never present a partial answer as complete, and never invent a result for
work that failed. If more work is genuinely needed, delegate again instead of
guessing.

## Playing an ARC-AGI-3 game

If the user asks for an ARC-AGI-3 game to be played (e.g. "play game ls20"),
delegate **exactly one** subtask with "type": "arc-game", no dependencies and no
other subtasks.

That subtask must carry "params": { "game_id": "<id>" }, an exact id from
\`arc_list_games\`. The param is what starts the play, and the "prompt" is never a
substitute for it: a subtask whose "game_id" is missing is rejected and the whole
call fails. Restate the request in the "prompt" as well (e.g. "Play the ARC-AGI-3
game ls20."), so the subagent knows what it was asked for.

If the request does not name a game, or names it loosely — a title, a level, "the
one with the puzzles" — call \`arc_list_games\` first and delegate the id that
matches. Never invent an id or pass through the user's wording as one. If nothing
in the list matches well enough to choose, ask the user which game they mean with
\`${FINAL_REPLY_TOOL_NAME}\` rather than guessing.

This runs long — acknowledge in your "reply" that you have started playing and will
report back, without promising a time.`;

/**
 * Appended when the Task has spent its budget (see {@link RoundMode}). Neither
 * `delegate` nor any work tool is declared in that case, so this explains a
 * constraint the model can already see rather than imposing one. `final_reply`
 * remains, and is the only way to end.
 *
 * It names the budget on purpose. "You cannot delegate" reads as a capability the
 * model should route around; "you have spent N turns" reads as a fact, and the
 * only sensible response to it is the answer.

answer the user from what you already have. You cannot delegate, look anything up,
or take any other action.

Give them everything you did manage. If something is missing or failed, say so
plainly in one short sentence — do not apologize at length, and do not describe
budgets, limits, or this constraint.`;
