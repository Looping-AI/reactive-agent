 * branch can drop it and no branch can invent it.

 * re-inferred — therefore report **0** structurally: they return before any model
 * runs, so the budget they hand back is untouched. That is exact on a clean
 * replay, where the Workflow's own cached step return already carries the original
 * number, and under-counts by one round when a step crashed mid-flight and re-ran.
