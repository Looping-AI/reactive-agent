 * A node is ready when it is still active and **every** dependency completed
 * successfully — `completed` specifically, not merely terminal: a dependent must
 * never run on a failed prerequisite's absent output.
 *
 * Ready ids come back in `ordinal` order. The Workflow builds durable step names
 * from them (`execute:<id>`), and step names are a cache key, so the traversal
 * that produces them has to be deterministic.
 *
 * **On `stuck`:** one "active nodes, none ready" check is the whole safety net. A
 * cycle, a self-dependency, and a dangling dependency id all manifest identically
 * here — every node in a cycle waits on a non-completed peer, a self-dependency
 * waits on its own non-completed self, and an unknown id resolves to `undefined`,
 * which is not `completed`. None of them are reachable: `createDecomposition`
 * validates the DAG before it persists a single row. So this is a loud assertion
 * for a corrupted DAG, not a control path — which is exactly why it is one check
 * and not three detectors that can never fire.
