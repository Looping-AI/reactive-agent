/**
 * The `final_reply` tool — the main agent answering the user itself, and the other
 * way a round can end.
 *
 * A round used to end either by calling `delegate` or by stopping with plain text,
 * and that asymmetry was the bug: to the code, "the model answered the user" and
 * "the model narrated an action it never took" were the same outcome — a non-empty
 * string. A model that wrote "I'll start the game" and emitted no call completed the
 * Task successfully, having done nothing.
 *
 * So prose is no longer an outcome. Both endings are now named tools, the round runs
 * with `toolChoice: "required"`, and a round that ends any other way has failed its
 * attempt. The *choice* is still entirely the model's — the point of the design (see
 * {@link file://./turn.ts turn.ts}) was never that the model be steered toward
 * delegating, only that it not be forced. Picking between two named tools is also a
 * far easier discrimination for a small model than picking between prose and a tool,
 * which is what the weaker fallback models kept getting wrong.
 *
 * This lives outside `subtasks/` deliberately: replying is not a subtask concept.

/**
 * The tool as the model sees it. **Without `execute`**, exactly like
 * {@link file://./subtasks/delegate.ts delegateTool}: the call *is* the round's
 * output, so there is nothing for the SDK to run and the loop halts on it.
 *
 * Unlike `delegate`, this call is never reconstructed in a later round's history —
 * a past reply is stored as, and replayed as, ordinary assistant text (history is
 * text-only by design). The tool exists to constrain *generation*, not to become a
 * new shape in the transcript.
