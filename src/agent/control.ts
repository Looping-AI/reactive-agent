/**
 * The **control tools** — the calls that end a round — and the one thing they all
 * need that the SDK cannot do for them: checking their own input.
 *
 * A work tool carries an `execute`, so the SDK validates its input against the
 * tool's schema, runs it, and feeds any failure — bad input, unknown tool, a throw
 * from inside — back into the loop as a failed tool result. The model sees what
 * went wrong and gets to try again, for free, for every work tool that exists or
 * ever will.
 *
 * A control tool has no `execute`. The call *is* the round's output, so the loop
 * halts on it and none of that machinery runs: **its input is never validated at
 * all**. That is not a subtlety, it is a hole. A `final_reply` whose `text` was
 * blank passed `nonBlank` untouched and was delivered to the user as an empty
 * message; a `delegate` whose payload was not a decomposition at all reached
 * {@link resolveDecomposition} and failed there on a raw `TypeError`.
 *
 * So each control tool declares a {@link ControlTool.parse}, and the round runs it
 * where the SDK would have: between the call and any use of it. `parse` either
 * produces the {@link TurnDecision} or throws, and a throw is handed straight back
 * to the model as a failed result for that call — the same repair loop, from the
 * same shape of feedback, that a work tool gets from the SDK. Adding a control tool
 * means writing its `parse`; it inherits validation and repair by existing.
